# Query
The aim of this query is to categorize the range of the flight for different aircrafts.
The range less than `4000` is `low range`, between `4000` to `7000` is `intermediate range` and more than that is `high range`.
The result is ordered by the range which is stored in a new column `flight_range` alphabetically.

### Usage of:
`SELECT`
